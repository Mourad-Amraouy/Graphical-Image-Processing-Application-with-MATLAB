# Graphical-Image-Processing-Application-with-MATLAB
Developed a user-friendly graphical interface application using MATLAB for advanced image processing, enabling efficient manipulation, analysis, and enhancement of digital images.



The Canny filter is certainly the most known and used filter for edge detection. I will explain step by step the canny filter for contour detection. Step by step because the canny filter is a multi-stage filter. The Canny filter is rarely integrated into a Deep Learning model. So I will describe the different parts and at the same time implement it with Pytorch. It can be customized almost without limit, I have allowed myself some deviations.
